### For Developers

#### Testing the System

```bash
# Run the app
npm start

# Navigate to http://localhost:3000/story
# You should see the Story Mode page with 9 episodes

# Episode 1 should be unlocked by default
# Click on it to view details and start the battle
```

#### Power Level Calculation

The system calculates player power based on:
```typescript
playerPower = 
  (unlockedMoves × 10) + 
  (unlockedCards × 15) + 
  (vaultShieldStrength) + 
  (vaultFirewall) + 
  (currentLevel)
```

#### Episode Unlocking Logic

- Episode 1: Always unlocked
- Episodes 2-9: Require previous episode completion + minimum power level
- Power gates ensure proper progression

## 🐛 Known Issues & Considerations

### Current Limitations
1. **Battle Mechanics**: Simplified compared to full battle system
   - No move selection (auto-attack only)
   - No action cards in story battles
   - No squad/team support

2. **Reward Granting**: Placeholder implementation
   - Fixed rewards are tracked but not fully granted to player inventory
   - Choice rewards need integration with move/item systems
   - Path rewards (Episode 9) need stat modification system

3. **Episode Progression**: Manual power requirement
   - Players need to complete challenges/battles to increase power
   - No guidance on how to reach required power levels
   - Could benefit from "recommended activities" hints

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Integrate Reward System**: Connect episode rewards to existing move/item systems
2. **Enhance Battle Mechanics**: Add move selection and action cards to story battles
3. **Add Tutorial**: Create onboarding for Story Mode first-time users
4. **Progress Hints**: Show players what they need to do to unlock next episode
5. **Save System**: Add mid-episode save points for longer battles
