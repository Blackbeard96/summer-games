## 💪 Increasing Your Power Level

Power Level determines which episodes you can access. Here's how to increase it:

### Power Level Formula
```
Your Power = 
  (Unlocked Moves × 10) + 
  (Unlocked Action Cards × 15) + 
  Vault Shield Strength + 
  Vault Firewall + 
  Current Level
```

### Ways to Increase Power
1. **Complete Challenges** → Earn XP → Level Up
2. **Unlock New Moves** → +10 power each
3. **Unlock Action Cards** → +15 power each
4. **Upgrade Your Vault** → Increases shield/firewall
5. **Complete Episodes** → Earn rewards that boost power

### Power Level Tips
- If an episode is locked, check the "Recommended Power" on its card
- The card will be color-coded:
  - 🟢 **Green**: You're overpowered (easy)
  - 🟡 **Yellow**: You're close (medium difficulty)
  - 🔴 **Red**: You need more power (hard)
